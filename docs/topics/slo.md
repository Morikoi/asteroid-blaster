# Service Level Objective (SLO)

Service Level Indicator (SLI) defines the quantitative measure of a service, for example error rates or request latency.

Service Level Objective (SLO) defines the value, or a range of values, that is measured by an SLI. 

Service Level Agreement (SLA) defines the implicit or explicit contract with users, and what happens when the SLO is not met.
