# eBPF

## Overview

> Instead of relying on static counters and gauges exposed by the operating system, eBPF enables the collection & in-kernel aggregation of custom metrics and generation of visibility events based on a wide range of possible sources. 

- [ebpf.io](https://ebpf.io/)
    - [Infrastructure](https://ebpf.io/infrastructure) including the Linux Kernel, Compilers (LLVM, gcc), Libraries (Go, C/C++, Rust)
    - [Applications](https://ebpf.io/applications)

## Projects

### Observability

- [Pixie](https://px.dev/), Kubernetes observability for developers, auto-instrumented, scriptable.   
- [Coroot](https://coroot.com/), Kubernetes Observability, implements service maps using eBPF. 
- [Parca](https://www.parca.dev/), Continuous Profiling 
- [ebpf_exporter](https://github.com/cloudflare/ebpf_exporter), Prometheus exporter for custom eBPF metrics 
- [OpenTelemetry eBPF Collectors](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ebpf), low level kernel telemetry data on a host Kernel, from the cloud or within a Kubernetes cluster.

### Security 

- [Cilium](https://cilium.io/), network connectivity security and observability
    - [Tetragon](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon)
- [Tracee](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tracee/latest/), Runtime Security and Forensics
- [Falco](https://falco.org/), Kubernetes threat detection engine. Use case example: Package dependency scanning with [GitLab Package Hunter](https://falco.org/blog/gitlab-falco-package-hunter/)

### SRE/DevOps 

- [Inspektor Gadget](https://www.inspektor-gadget.io/), A collection of eBPF-based gadgets to debug and inspect Kubernetes apps and resources 
- [Caretta](https://github.com/groundcover-com/caretta), instant Kubernetes service dependency map in Grafana, using VictoriaMetrics as backend. 
- [BumbleBee](https://github.com/solo-io/bumblebee), build, run and distribute eBPF programs using OCI images.
