# o11y.love - learn Observability

Getting started with Observability, or looking for new ideas for your own environments? There are so many great resources out there - you've come to a place trying to collect them all :)

## Introduction

o11y.love is a collection of helpful URLs and tutorials, originally started by Michael Friedrich, [@dnsmichi](https://twitter.com/dnsmichi) in January 2022. Created for and maintained by the community. 

`o11y` is a numeronym similar to `k8s`. `k8s = k <8 chars> s = Kubernetes`. `o11y = o <11 chars> y = Observability`.

### What is Observability

Over the years, many definitions were explained, discussed and created. [Michael Friedrich](https://dnsmichi.at/about/), maintainer of this platform, says:

> Modern application development and deployment with microservices and cloud-native technologies require a new approach beyond traditional metrics monitoring. 
>
> Collecting all types of events helps answer known questions, and identify unknown unknowns. 
>
> Who knew that a DNS response latency in CI/CD pipelines caused the deployment cost to rise significantly? This describes Observability, and how it can help reduce infrastructure costs.


Ted Young explains the motivation, rights and wrongs (3 pillars), and which data we are looking at and correlating, in the first video on the future of Observability and OpenTelemetry. A great introduction to watch and learn :)

There are more definitions and tools to dive into.
